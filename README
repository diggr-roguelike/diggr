To run the game, type

 ./diggr

To run the highscore and achievement viewer and game replayer, type

 ./diggr-replayer

Please visit the official site, http://code.google.com/p/diggr-roguelike for more info.

Also, the Diggr Global Online Score Table is available over at http://diggr.name
You can place an entry into the global highscore from the game itself.

If you are running a 64-bit distribution with an older glibc version, type

 ./diggr-fix-glibc

I bundled a glibc 2.15 binary with the game.



REQUIREMENTS:

* Python. All modern Linux distributions have this pre-installed.

* The SDL libraries. 

* The jack audio toolkit if you want sound.


  To install them under Ubuntu, Debian or Mint, type:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian jackd2

  To install them under RedHat, Fedora or CentOS, type:

    sudo yum install SDL jack-audio-connection-kit

  To install under Arch Linux, type:

    sudo pacman -S sdl jack2
    
NOTE: I recommend installing jack2, not jack. The two are equavelent from the point of view of a 
program that uses them; however, jack2 is more user-friendly and should work out-of-the-box 
without extra configuration steps.
