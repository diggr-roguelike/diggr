PREREQUISITES:
-------------
Building for Windows is only tested for the MinGW cross-compilation environment, http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org


BUILDING FROM SOURCE:
--------------------

1. Install cmake. You will need it for building. 

2. Check out prerequisites:

   git submodule update --init --recursive

3. Build and install:

  sh build.sh

NOTE: A saner build process is impossible due to the authors of CMake being braindead.
Please don't use or support CMake if you can.

4. A working installation of the game will be in ../dist
